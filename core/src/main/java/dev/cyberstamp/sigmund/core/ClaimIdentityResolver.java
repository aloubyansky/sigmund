/**
 * Resolves who the key behind a verified OpenPGP claim belongs to, by adding the identities a
 * directory vouches for, where policy needs them.
 *
 * <p>
 * An OpenPGP signature proves a key, not who holds it. When a signer is named by address with
 * a directory as issuer, the directory is asked which verified addresses it serves for the
 * signing key, and each becomes an {@link IdentityCredential} the claim proves. That is what
 * lets policy accept a publisher's key generated after the policy was written.
 *
 * <p>
 * The directory is asked only when the answer can matter: for an artifact whose expected
 * signers include an email entry a directory can vouch for, and for a claim whose key none of
 * those signers' pinned fingerprints already accepts. A signer carrying both fingerprints and
 * an address therefore verifies offline for the keys already pinned, and only a new key costs
 * a lookup.
 *
 * <p>
 * A lookup that fails leaves the claim {@link IndeterminateReason#KEY_UNAVAILABLE}, never a
 * pass and never a rejection: whether the signer is trusted could not be decided.
