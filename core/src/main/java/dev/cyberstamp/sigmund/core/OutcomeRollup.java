 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>any failed claim wins — a valid claim alongside a failing one does not mask it;</li>
 * <li>claims no installed tool supports are set aside: they cannot satisfy a requirement, and
 * cannot block one that the other claims meet;</li>
 * <li>no applicable rule means {@link ArtifactOutcome#NOT_CONFIGURED};</li>
 * <li>requirements met, honouring the claim-set mode, means
 * {@link ArtifactOutcome#SATISFIED};</li>
 * <li>otherwise whichever remaining state is most informative decides: an unresolved claim
 * first; then requirements left unmet only for want of a tool, which are
 * {@link IndeterminateReason#UNSUPPORTED_ALGORITHM}; then any other claim, which leaves a signer
 * the requirements do not accept; and last no evidence at all.</li>
