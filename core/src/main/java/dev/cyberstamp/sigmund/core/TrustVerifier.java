/**
 * Consumer use case — identity-based trust assessment.
 * <p>
 * Answers "is this artifact from someone I trust?" by combining evidence verification
 * with trust policy matching.
 *
 * <h2>Assessment flow</h2>
 * <ol>
 * <li><strong>Verify evidence</strong> — every evidence file is read once and each provider that
 * handles it verifies its claims, so a {@link ClaimResult} is recorded for every claim found,
 * whether or not it ends up mattering.</li>
 * <li><strong>Resolve identities</strong> — where the matched rule names a directory-backed
 * identity, the directory is asked about the keys the claims proved.</li>
 * <li><strong>Match the rule</strong> — the most specific {@link Rule} for the artifact is
 * selected once and recorded on the result as a {@link MatchedRule}.</li>
 * <li><strong>Roll up</strong> — the shared roll-up evaluates the rule's {@link Requirement}
 * over the verified claims and derives the {@link ArtifactOutcome}; no rule means
 * {@link ArtifactOutcome#NOT_CONFIGURED}.</li>
 * </ol>
 * What the outcome does to the build is not decided here: enforcement is resolved from the
 * recorded rule by {@link VerificationReport}, so that observing and enforcing runs report the
 * same results.
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * TrustVerifier verifier = sigmund.verifier(
 *         RulePolicy.compile(config.trustPolicySpec(), config.signers()));
 * ArtifactResult result = verifier.assess(coords, artifactFile, evidenceFiles);
 * if (result.outcome() == ArtifactOutcome.SATISFIED) { ... }
 * }</pre>
